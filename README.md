# Queues-Management-System

## Overview

Queues Management is a Java-based project focused on simulating and managing queue processing through multithreading. It demonstrates how concurrent programming enhances performance by allowing tasks to be processed in parallel, reducing wait times and improving efficiency.

## Purpose

This project is designed to:

- Simulate a queue management system with a configurable number of clients and servers.
- Utilize Java's multithreading capabilities to process tasks concurrently.
- Implement synchronization mechanisms to ensure thread safety.
- Provide a structured simulation of real-world queue management scenarios.

## System Design

The system is structured around Object-Oriented Programming principles and employs a **Scheduler** to efficiently distribute tasks among **Server** instances. Key components include:

- **Task**: Represents a client, characterized by an ID, arrival time, and processing duration.
- **Server**: Simulates a processing unit handling a queue of tasks.
- **Scheduler**: Implements load distribution strategies to assign tasks to available servers.
- **SimulationManager**: Orchestrates the simulation process and updates the graphical interface with real-time data.

## Features

- **Concurrent Processing**: Uses Java's threading model to manage multiple queues simultaneously.
- **Optimized Task Allocation**: Implements strategies to balance the workload across servers dynamically.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle an increasing number of tasks efficiently.
- **Real-time Simulation**: Visual representation of queue behavior under different conditions.
- **Thread Safety**: Utilizes **BlockingQueue** and **AtomicInteger** to prevent concurrency issues.

## Key Takeaways and Future Improvements

This project highlights the importance of multithreading, synchronization, and OOP in handling complex queue management scenarios. Future enhancements could include implementing adaptive load balancing strategies and integrating database persistence for long-term tracking of queue data.
